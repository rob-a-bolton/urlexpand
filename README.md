# Usage
Pipe URLS into urlextend (and optionally give more as arguments - these take first priority in the return order) and it will print their destinations.  

You can provide urls with only arguments if you close the input to it.

# Requirements
Chicken Scheme, and the followings eggs:
    - uri-common
    - intarweb
    - openssl (optional, recommend)
